git init - initialize repository
git add - adds to stage
git commit - moves to repository
git log - checks all commits done
git diff - checks the changes done to a specific file
git checkout - discards all changes made
git status - can check all changes from last commit
git remote - checks what your remote repository
git remote add origin <githib repository link>
git push <remote> <branch name> - uploads your local changes to your remote repository

origin is the name to my remote

remember 3 tree in git:

WD (working directory) - actual files you interacted with
Stage - from WD through git add
Repository - from stage to git commit

WD------------Stage--------------Repository

  ----------->     ------------->
    git add	     git commit

every single addition must be committed.

github vs git
git - is the tool, is locally accessible
github - cloud service that manages git repositories

commits done in local must be uploaded to github
